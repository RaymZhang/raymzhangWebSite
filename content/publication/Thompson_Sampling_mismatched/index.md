abstract:   "We consider Thompson Sampling (TS) for linear combinatorial semi-bandits and subgaussian rewards. We propose the first known TS whose finite-time regret does not scale exponentially with the dimension of the problem. We further show the “mismatched sampling paradox”: A learner who knows the rewards distributions and samples from the correct posterior distribution can perform exponentially worse than a learner who does not know the rewards and simply samples from a well-chosen Gaussian posterior. The code used to generate the experiments is available at \href{https://github.com/RaymZhang/CTS-Mismatched-Paradox}{https://github.com/RaymZhang/CTS-Mismatched-Paradox}"

summary: We propose the first known Thompson Sampling for combinatorial bandits whose finite-time regret does not scale exponentially with the dimension of the problem. Suprisingly, considering any subgaussian distribution as a gaussian can produce exponentialy better result.
