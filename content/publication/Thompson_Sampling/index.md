abstract: 'In this paper we consider Thompson Sampling
  (TS) for combinatorial semi-bandits. We demonstrate that, perhaps
  surprisingly, TS is sub-optimal for this problem in the sense that its regret
  scales exponentially in the ambient dimension, and its minimax regret scales
  almost linearly for some well chosen exemples that may not be that uncommon. '
