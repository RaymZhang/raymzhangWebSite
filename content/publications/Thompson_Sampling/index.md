  In this paper we consider Thompson Sampling (TS) for combinatorial
  semi-bandits. We demonstrate that, perhaps surprisingly, TS is sub-optimal for
  this problem in the sense that its regret scales exponentially in the ambient
  dimension, and its minimax regret scales almost linearly for some well chosen
  exemples that may not be that uncommon.
